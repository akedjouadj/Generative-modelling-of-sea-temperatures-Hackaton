# Generative-modelling-of-sea-temperatures-Hackaton

### Read the file Evaluation_hackgen2.pdf and genhack2_part2.pdf to understand the context of the hackaton.

The competition lasted 1 month, 2 weeks for each part. We developed a Score-based generative model in the first part (see the file Genhack2_SBG_Model_rapport.pdf for explanation and model.py for code) and a conditionnal GAN model in the second part (see model_cond.py for code).
